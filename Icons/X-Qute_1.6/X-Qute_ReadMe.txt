X-Qute Icon Set 1.60 for Total Commander 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

X-Qute is an icon set for button bar of Total Commander (http://www.ghisler.com)

X-Qute is based on Arvid Axelsson's Qute icon set for an old Firefox version

Thanks to Arvid Axelsson for his kind permission to use some of his artwork in 
this icon set.

Additional icons are created by me (X-Byte)
These icons are for personal use and copyright restrictions apply. 
Please contact me if you want to use them for other purposes.

The icons are created for use with Windows 8/7/Vista/XP/2000 (alpha channel)
with 32x32 pixel and 16x16 pixel which also scale nice at 24x24 pixel.

INSTALLATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Preconfigured X-Qute Button Bar]
- Unpack this archive including subdirs in your Total Commander directory
- Start Total Commander (if not already running ;)
- Open Configuration -> Button Bar -> Button Bar -> [>>]
- Browse your Total Commander directory and select X-Qute.bar
- Decide whether or not you want this to be your default bar
- Delete all Buttons you don't need for your daily TC life
- Change position/appearance/size of buttons according to your personal taste
- Suggested size is either 32, 24 or 16 for best viewing results

[Customizing your own Button Bar with X-Qute icons]
- Unpack X-Qute.dll and X-Qute.inc in a directory (e.g. your TC directory)
- Start Total Commander (if not already running ;)
- Open Configuration -> Button Bar
- Select the desired Command and options for your button
- Click on: Icon file -> [>>]
- Choose X-Qute.dll -> [Open]
- TC6: Select the appropriate X-Qute icon out of the displayed icon palette
- TC7+: The associated icon for this command gets automatically selected! 
- Repeat these steps for all of your icons :-)  

There are some additional icons included for which Total Commander doesn't offer
a specific command (cm_*), like the Android Device or iPhone Device. You have to 
assign them manually, if you want to make use of them.

Some commands of the buttons are not associated with a proper tooltip 
description, showing only the specific cm_ as tooltip. You may change this by
editing the Tooltip field in the Button Bar configuration dialog manually.
